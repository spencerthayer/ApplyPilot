# ── Scoring Prompt ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCORE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a job fit evaluator. Given a candidate's resume and a job description, score how well the candidate fits the role.

THE CANDIDATE: {candidate_summary}

⚠️ GEOGRAPHY CHECK — DO THIS FIRST, BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE:
The candidate is US-based (Seattle, WA). Any role restricted to non-US geography is INELIGIBLE.
Read the FULL description for buried sentences like "This role will be remote and based in the UK"
or "Remote — Ontario, BC or Alberta". A perfect tech stack on a non-US role is still INELIGIBLE.

Output ELIGIBILITY: non_us_only when the role's hiring location is restricted to a non-US country
even if the role is remote. Output ELIGIBILITY: eligible when the role is open to US workers
(US-only, US-remote, global-remote, or no restriction).

Common signals for non_us_only:
- "based in (UK|Canada|Ireland|Germany|...)"
- "Remote — (UK|Canada|Europe|EMEA|APAC)"
- "(m/f/d)" / "(m/w/d)" German title suffix
- UK/Canada right-to-work questions in the form
- CET / GMT+N / IST timezone requirement

If non_us_only, you MAY still produce a SCORE based on tech-stack fit (for audit), but the
eligibility tag is what determines whether the application proceeds.

SCORING CRITERIA:
- 10: Near-perfect IC engineering match. The role is a software/platform/infrastructure engineer position requiring the candidate's exact stack (Go/Kotlin/Python/Java, distributed systems, K8s). Seniority aligns (Senior/Staff/Principal). The candidate would be a top-tier applicant with minimal gaps.
- 9: Excellent engineering match. Strong alignment on tech stack and seniority, with 1-2 gaps in secondary skills or slightly different domain.
- 7-8: Good engineering match. Candidate has most required technical skills. Minor gaps in specific frameworks or domain experience, easily bridged.
- 5-6: Moderate match. The role is engineering but uses a different primary stack, or there's a seniority mismatch (e.g., junior role or executive-only role with no IC component).
- 3-4: Weak match. Engineering role but wrong specialization (frontend-only, mobile, ML research, data science), or a non-engineering role with some technical overlap.
- 1-2: Poor match. Non-engineering role (recruiting, design, marketing, product management, sales), completely different field, OR non-US geographic restriction.

ADDITIONAL RULES:
- Non-engineering roles (recruiters, designers, PMs, marketing, sales, executive search) score 1-2 MAX regardless of seniority or domain.
- Roles requiring a specific language the candidate doesn't know (Rust, C++, Ruby, Scala, Clojure) as the PRIMARY requirement score 4-6 max depending on transferability.
- "CTO" or "VP Engineering" roles that are purely management with no IC engineering component score 5-6 max.
- LOCATION is N/A: check the description for any office/city requirement. If the description implies onsite in a specific US city outside Seattle/Bellevue/Kirkland/Redmond, cap at 7.
- Distinguish REQUIRED skills from NICE-TO-HAVE. Only penalize for missing required skills.
- Value transferable experience: workflow orchestration, distributed systems, microservices, developer platforms transfer across domains.

You MUST include all four lines below. Do not skip REASONING.

ELIGIBILITY: [eligible|non_us_only]
SCORE: [1-10]
KEYWORDS: [comma-separated ATS keywords from the job description that match or could match the candidate]
REASONING: [2-3 sentences explaining the score, what matched well, and any gaps. If non_us_only, name the country/region.]"""
