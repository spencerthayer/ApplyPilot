STRUCTURE: 4 paragraphs. TARGET 300-400 words; MINIMUM 260 words (Jobscan 3.4x interview-rate sweet spot is 250-400). Letters under 260 words get rejected automatically.

PARAGRAPH 1 — HOOK (4-6 sentences, ~80 words): Open with a specific thing YOU built that solves THEIR problem. Identify the problem they're hiring to solve (infer from the job description) and name the work you've done that directly addresses it. Include enough context that the reader understands the scope and impact. Not "I'm excited about this role." Not "This role aligns with my experience." Start with the work.

PARAGRAPH 2 — EVIDENCE (4-6 sentences, ~120 words): Pick 2 achievements from the resume that are MOST relevant to THIS job. For each, name the problem, the concrete action you took (specific tools, architecture decisions), and the quantified outcome. Use numbers. Frame each as solving their problem, not listing your accomplishments.{projects_hint}{metrics_hint}

PARAGRAPH 3 — COMPANY FIT (3-4 sentences, ~70 words): Reference one specific thing about the company from the job description (a product, a technical challenge, a team structure). Connect it to your experience with a concrete parallel, not a generic nod. Show you've read the posting and that you've solved a similar shape of problem.
If COMPANY is marked unknown, infer the employer from the job description. If the description doesn't name it either, write about the team's product and problem domain WITHOUT naming any company. NEVER treat the job board the listing came from (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) as the employer.

PARAGRAPH 4 — CLOSE (2 sentences, ~30 words): Offer to go deeper on one or two SPECIFIC topics from your evidence paragraph, naming the actual system, migration, or metric. Write the offer in your own words; do not use stock closers ("Happy to walk through...", "I'd welcome the chance to discuss..."). Then sign off.

BANNED WORDS/PHRASES (using ANY of these = instant rejection):
"resonated", "aligns with", "passionate", "eager", "eager to", "excited to apply", "I am confident",
"I believe", "proven track record", "strong track record", "cutting-edge", "innovative", "innovative solutions",
"leverage", "leveraging", "robust", "driven", "dedicated", "committed to",
"I look forward to hearing from you", "great fit", "unique opportunity",
"commitment to excellence", "dynamic team", "fast-paced environment",
"I am writing to express", "caught my eye", "caught my attention"

BANNED PUNCTUATION: No em dashes. Use commas or periods.

VOICE:
- Write like a real engineer emailing someone they respect. Not formal, not casual. Just direct.
- NEVER narrate or explain what you're doing. BAD: "This demonstrates my commitment to X." GOOD: Just state the fact and move on.
- NEVER hedge. BAD: "might address some of your challenges." GOOD: "solves the same problem your team is facing."
- NEVER use "Also," to start a sentence. NEVER use "Furthermore," or "Additionally,".
- Every sentence should contain either a number, a tool name, or a specific outcome. If it doesn't, cut it.
- Read it out loud. If it sounds like a robot wrote it, rewrite it.

ADDITIONAL BANNED PHRASES:
"This demonstrates", "This reflects", "This showcases", "This shows",
"This experience translates", "which aligns with", "which is relevant to",
"as demonstrated by", "showing experience with", "reflecting the need for",
"which directly addresses", "I have experience with",
"Also,", "Furthermore,", "Additionally,", "Moreover,",
"Happy to walk through", "demonstrate" (any form: demonstrates, demonstrated, demonstrating),
"resonate" (any form), "align with" (any form: aligns with, aligned with)

FABRICATION = INSTANT REJECTION:
The candidate's real tools are ONLY: {skills_str}.
Do NOT mention ANY tool not in this list. If the job asks for tools not listed, talk about the work you did, not the tools.

Sign off: just "{sign_off_name}"

Output ONLY the letter. Start with "Dear Hiring Manager," end with the name."""
