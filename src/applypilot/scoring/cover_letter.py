STRUCTURE: 3 short paragraphs. Under 250 words. Every sentence must earn its place.

PARAGRAPH 1 (2-3 sentences): Open with a specific thing YOU built that solves THEIR problem. Not "I'm excited about this role." Not "This role aligns with my experience." Start with the work.

PARAGRAPH 2 (3-4 sentences): Pick 2 achievements from the resume that are MOST relevant to THIS job. Use numbers. Frame as solving their problem, not listing your accomplishments.{projects_hint}{metrics_hint}

PARAGRAPH 3 (1-2 sentences): One specific thing about the company from the job description (a product, a technical challenge, a team structure). Then close. "Happy to walk through any of this in more detail." or "Let's discuss." Nothing else.

BANNED WORDS/PHRASES (using ANY of these = instant rejection):
"resonated", "aligns with", "passionate", "eager", "eager to", "excited to apply", "I am confident",
"I believe", "proven track record", "strong track record", "cutting-edge", "innovative", "innovative solutions",
"leverage", "leveraging", "robust", "driven", "dedicated", "committed to",
"I look forward to hearing from you", "great fit", "unique opportunity",
"commitment to excellence", "dynamic team", "fast-paced environment",
"I am writing to express", "caught my eye", "caught my attention"

BANNED PUNCTUATION: No em dashes. Use commas or periods.

VOICE:
- Write like a real engineer emailing someone they respect. Not formal, not casual. Just direct.
- NEVER narrate or explain what you're doing. BAD: "This demonstrates my commitment to X." GOOD: Just state the fact and move on.
- NEVER hedge. BAD: "might address some of your challenges." GOOD: "solves the same problem your team is facing."
- NEVER use "Also," to start a sentence. NEVER use "Furthermore," or "Additionally,".
- Every sentence should contain either a number, a tool name, or a specific outcome. If it doesn't, cut it.
- Read it out loud. If it sounds like a robot wrote it, rewrite it.

ADDITIONAL BANNED PHRASES:
"This demonstrates", "This reflects", "This showcases", "This shows",
"This experience translates", "which aligns with", "which is relevant to",
"as demonstrated by", "showing experience with", "reflecting the need for",
"which directly addresses", "I have experience with",
"Also,", "Furthermore,", "Additionally,", "Moreover,"

FABRICATION = INSTANT REJECTION:
The candidate's real tools are ONLY: {skills_str}.
Do NOT mention ANY tool not in this list. If the job asks for tools not listed, talk about the work you did, not the tools.

Sign off: just "{sign_off_name}"

Output ONLY the letter. Start with "Dear Hiring Manager," end with the name."""
